Lab Manager Light extends existing virtualization farms like VMware vSphere and potentially others with advanced network and system management to build a private cloud without the complexity of running cloud solutions.

Users can provision and manage their own virtual machines, LML will:
  * enforce VM name compliance with corporate standards
  * set the host-name to the VM name
  * assign VMs to users
  * manage end-of-life dates for VMs
  * integrate with corporate user accounts
  * manage IP addresses through a DHCP server
  * manage DNS names through a DNS server
  * control PXE boot environment for automated installation of VMs
  * manage host-based entries in a SVN repository for automated systems integration

LML communicates with the end-user through the existing GUIs of the virtualization farm and the virtual machines.

Take a look at the ArchitectureOverview and ScreenShots and follow the instructions at InstallationAndSetup to install LML.
